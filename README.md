# Credit-Card-Usage-Segmentation
This project focuses on developing unsupervised learning models for customer segmentation based on credit card usage data. The models aim to provide insights into distinct customer segments, improve credit risk assessment, and optimize marketing strategies. Deliverables include segmentation models, comprehensive data visualizations, and a comparative analysis of various algorithms..

# Credit Card Customer Segmentation

This project uses unsupervised machine learning to segment credit card customers based on their spending and payment behavior.

## 🎯 Objective
To identify distinct customer segments that can help improve marketing, risk management, and customer retention strategies.

## 🧠 Techniques Used
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Preprocessing (Handling Missing Values, Scaling)
- Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)
- Clustering Algorithms:
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering (Agglomerative)
  - Comparison of Clustering Models

## 📊 Visualizations
- Correlation Heatmap
- Feature Distributions
- PCA Scatter Plot
- Cluster-wise Spending Patterns
